# Flask_landingpage_project
I am learning programming (specifically Python and Flask) by building a simple landing page with a subscription form.

I am using ChatGPT as a tool for searching, debugging and keeping track of
the project.

To run the program:
* Download the project
* Open terminal and enter following commands:
* `cd /home/user/path_to_the_project/Flask_landingpage_project`    (Open the folder of the project on your computer)
* `python3 app.py runserver`       (Run the python command to start the server)

  Now the app is running.
  You can now open the browser and type the address of the page:

  http://localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/
