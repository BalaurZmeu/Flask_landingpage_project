# Flask_landingpage_project
I am learning programming (specifically Python and Flask) by building a simple landing page with a subscription form.

I am using ChatGPT as a tool for searching, debugging and keeping track of
the project.

To run the program:
* Download the project
* Open terminal and enter following commands:
* cd /home/user/path_to_the_project/Flask_landingpage_project
* python3 app.py runserver

  Now the app is running.
  You can open the browser and input the address of the page:
  localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/
