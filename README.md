# Flask_landingpage_project
I am learning web programming (specifically Python and Flask) by building a simple landing page with a subscription form.

To run the program:
* Download the project
* Open terminal, navigate to the `Flask_landingpage_project-main` directory and run:
* `python app.py runserver`       (Run the development server)

  Now the app is running.
  You can open the browser and type the address of the page:

  http://localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/

The webpage displays a simple subscription form. When the visitor of the page enters information in the **'Name'** and **'Email'** fields, providing their name and email, and clicks the **'Subscribe'** button, the entered data is saved in the `user_data.csv` file. Subsequently, the **'Thank you'** page is displayed.
